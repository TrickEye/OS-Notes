# Chapt5. Command Line Environment.

## Job control

You may have seen this before: when a process is running, give it `^C`, shell will interrupt the process and return to you. Actually, this is one of the system signals, `SIGINT`. 

`sleep 2000` sleeps 2000 seconds. While this is running, type `^C` will interrupt this process, by sending a signal called `SIGINT`

`man signal` displays a long list of many signals UNIX support. 

Please read the following example of how you handle `SIGINT` instead of letting it interrupt your process: [illustration](signalHandler.py) In this program, when python gets a `SIGINT`, instead of terminating the process, it prints that it receives a `SIGINT`. Since `^C` is no longer working, to really terminate the program, you can use `^\`, which generates a `SIGQUIT` signal that wasn't handled in the python script. (This key binding wasn't supported till WSL2.

| sign | name | key bindings | note |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| `SIGINT` | signal interrupt | ^C | / |
| `SIGQUIT` | signal quit | ^\ | / |
| `SIGSTOP` | signal stop | ^Z | / |
| `SIGKILL` | signal kill | | can't be captured by program |
| `SIGHUP` | signal hangup | | when you log off |

If you `^Z` or `SIGSTOP` a program, it will tell you in the shell that it was suspended. 

A `&` at the end of the command tells shell to run the program at the background.

`jobs` lists all running / suspended jobs the machine is running. 

`bg %n` continues the particular job, specified by `n`, it actually recovers the process at background. If you want foreground, use `fg`. 

`kill -STOP %n` stops a job, specified by `n`.

`kill -HUP %n` will hang up a job. 

`nohup` before a command prohibits a hang up signal to hang up the process.

## Terminal multiplexers

A multiplexer creates different work spaces to work in. Like tmux.

### A hierarchy: Sessions, windows, panes.

Type `tmux`, which brings us a new interface, quite like bash, but different. You can do things just as you do in a normal shell. 

Pay attention to the key binding `^B + D`(please note, press ctrl B at the first place, then leave ctrl, press D), which is **detach**, this will return, or detach to bash, with all process still running. 

To get back, or **reattach**, use `tmux a`. Or, `tmux a -t name` may bring you back to the accurate process.

You can create a new session with `tmux new -t name`, to kill one, use `tmux kill-session -t xxx`.

`tmux ls` tells you the sessions you have.

---
When you are within a session, you can create a new window with key binding `^B + C`. 

Use key binding `^B + P or N`, (P for previous, N for next) to switch between windows. You can also use numbers: `^B + 1` jumps to the 1st window. 

`^B + ,` will rename the current window.

---
`^B + " or %` splits the current display into 2 panes (" splits upper and lower, % splits left and right). You can run any process in the new pane. 

To move through panes, use `^B + arrowKeys` 

If you intend to rearrange the panes, use `^B + Space` to switch in different layouts.

When the pane is too small to view, you can use `^B + Z`(Z for zoom) to zoom into the pane, use the key binding again to go back. 

## Dotfiles

Alias: maps a short series of letter into a long string of command, which will be much more handy to call later.
```BASH
alias ll="ls -lah"
```

If you intend to keep such aliases persistent, you can use what's called dot files. 

`~/.bashrc` is one of the dot files.

Not only can you add `alias xxx=xxx` in `~/.bashrc`, you can also modify many other settings in this file. 

An example would be `PS1` string, or, prompt String.

Typically your home directory should look like: 
```
~
|--.bashrc
|--.vimrc
|--dotfiles
   |--bashrc
   |--vimrc
```

## Remote machines
I don't think I need this.
