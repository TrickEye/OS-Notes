# Chapt2. Shell Tools and Scripting.

```
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ foo=bar
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ echo $foo
bar
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ echo "i am $foo"
i am bar
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ echo 'i am $foo'
i am $foo
```

Now for a flow of control: 
```
mcd.sh:---------------
|   mcd () {
|       mkdir -p "$1"
|       cd "$1"
|   }
 ---------------------
source mcd.sh
mcd test
```
I don't know why this does not work on my computer, maybe it's ZSH support.

`$xx`is specially reserved for arguments related usages. `$1` is for argument no.1, `$2` through `$9`is similar. `$?`is the error code of the last command, while `$_`, last argument of the previous command.

`!!` will be replaced with the last command, this is usefuk if you intend to `sudo` the last failed attempt. (`sudo !!`)

---

## basic logic commands

We have `true` and `false`, which returns error code `0` and `1` and let's see:
```BASH
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ false || echo "fail"
fail
```
In `||`, if the first one do not have a `0` error code, it will try the 2nd one. In this case it will run the second one.
```BASH
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ true && echo "Things went well"
Things went well
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ false && echo "This will not print"
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$
```
for logical and, `&&`, it will do the first one, and if the first one has `0` error code, the second one will be done.
```
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ false ; echo "This will always print"
This will always print
```
commands on the both sides of `;` will be executed, no matter what condition.

```BASH
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ foo=$(pwd)
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ echo $foo
/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye
trickeye@TrickEye-SurfaceLaptop3:/mnt/c/Users/TrickEye$ echo "We are in $foo"
We are in /mnt/c/Users/TrickEye
```
getting a command's output into a variable, and use string substitution.

```BASH
cat <(ls) <(ls ..)
```
`<()` means to put the output into a temporary file and as the input of the current command. Multiple `<()` will concatinate the temporary files.

---
## Script example

| sign | explanation |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| `$()` | the output of the command, as a String substitution | 
| `$0` | the name of the script we are running |
| `$#` | the number of arguments we are giving |
| `$$` | the process id, or pid of the command running |
| `$@` | expand to all arguments |
| `2>` | redirect the stderr |
| `/dev/null` | whatever writes in that will be discarded | 
| `-ne` | not equal `if [["$?" -ne 0]]; then ... fi` |

```BASH
echo "Starting program at $(date)" 

echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"

for file in "$@"; do
    grep foobar "$file" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    # When pattern is not found, grep has exit status 1
    if [[ "$?" -ne 0]]; then
        echo "File $file does not have any foobar, adding one"
        echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
    fi
done
```

## globbing
`ls *.sh` lists all files with postfix `.sh`

`ls project?` ? matches exactly 1 character.

`convert image.{png,jpg}` will be expanded into `convert image.pn image.jpg`, furtherly, you can `touch project{1,2}/src/test/test{1,2,3}.py`. You can even `touch {foo,bar}/{a..j}`

`diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)`checks what files are different.

## other scripts
you can run python in Shell
```
script.py--------------------------------
|   #!/usr/local/bin/python
|   import sys
|   for arg in reversed(sys.argv[1:]):
|       print(arg)
 ----------------------------------------
```
the first line is **`shebang`**, telling Shell how to run this script

`shellcheck mcd.sh` checks and gives you warnings and errors of the file.

## find

`find . -name src -type d` to find **in the current directory** for **directories** with names called **src**, `find . -path '**/test/*.py' -type f` to find **files** called ***.py** within a folder called **test**, **no matter the path** of folder 'test'.
`find . -mtime -1` find modified **in the last day**.

find can even execute something. `find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;`

`locate` looks for paths in the computer.

`grep -R foobar .` recursively search for **foobar** in directory `.`

---
## Navigating:

`tree` and the upgraded version, `broot`, lists like a tree, and `nnn`.
