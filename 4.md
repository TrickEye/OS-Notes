# Chapt4. Data Wranggling.

## Find a source of data to wranggle.

```BASH
ssh myserver journalctl
```

## Filter

`grep` will be your friend. Let's improve from the last line: 
```BASH
ssh myserver 'journalctl | grep sshd | grep "Disconnected from"' | less
```
Here, `ssh myserver` links your server, runs the next command you give to it. For the first example of this page, it will run `journalctl` on the server, if you give `ssh` a string with `''`, ssh runs the whole string as a command.

## Introducing `SED`

`sed` modifies a file using some simple commands. Here's a basic example: 
```
ssh myserver journalctl | grep sshd | grep "Disconnected from"
 | sed 's/.*Disconnected from //'
```
Here is a simple illustration of REGEX to substitute s string. The basic mode is `s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION`. 

If you intend to substitute every match, use `s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/g`, g for GLOBAL. `/m` is for multi line.

Sometimes `sed` needs parameter `-E` to match with the common behaviour of REGEX.

Here's a [REGEX Debugger](https://regex101.com/r/qqbZqh/2) for Regex debugging.

Capture group is also useful. If you intend to substitute a String with what you captured in a group, try `sed s/REGEX/\1/`, here `\1` stands for the capture group no.1.

## Back to data wranggling.

`sort` sorts a series of data, even given no arguments, it will still function fine.

`sort -n` sorts with number, `-k1,1` sorts with column 1 to 1, with deliminater '\s'. `sort -r` sorts in reverse order. 

`uniq -c` foldz multiple occurrances and prefix them with the time they appear (enabled by -c).

`head -n1`, or `tail -n10` displays only the top (or the bottom) n lines.

`wc -l` counts the number of lines.

## awk

`awk` is another language enables you to process the text treating like arguments. Here's an illustration:  
```BASH
| awk '{print $2}' | 
| awk '$1 == 1 && $2 ~ /^c[^ ]*e$/ { print $2 }' |
| awk 'BEGIN{rows = 0} $1 == 1 && $2~/^c[^ ]*e$/ {rows+=1} END {print rows} |
